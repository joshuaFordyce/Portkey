# Portkey: The Cross-Cloud Orchestrator üóùÔ∏è

**Project Overview:** `Portkey` is a declarative, multi-platform orchestrator that solves a critical problem for enterprise data teams: managing a fragmented data ecosystem that spans multiple platforms (e.g., Snowflake and Trino) and multiple cloud environments. It provides a single, intelligent interface for orchestrating complex, cross-platform queries, optimizing their performance, and ensuring data is moved in a consistent, reliable way.

`Portkey` is not just a tool; it's a strategic platform that empowers data engineers to solve a class of problems that is often handled by a team of experts. It eliminates manual, error-prone processes and provides a single, unified approach to managing a complex, multi-cloud data ecosystem.

### Key Features ‚ú®

* **LLM-Powered Query Orchestration:** Uses an LLM to take a single query and intelligently break it into a series of subqueries that can be executed on both Snowflake and Trino. The LLM's role is to act as a query orchestrator, ensuring that the query is executed in the most efficient way possible.
* **Cross-Platform Performance Optimization:** Analyzes a query's execution plan and suggests the most efficient way to execute it. This includes pushing down computation to the correct platform and minimizing data movement between platforms.
* **Data Ingestion and Synchronization:** Manages data ingestion between the two platforms, ensuring that the data is moved and transformed in a consistent, reliable way. This includes handling schema changes, data type mismatches, and other common data-engineering challenges.
* **Declarative Orchestration:** The entire orchestration process is defined in a single, declarative configuration file. This provides a single source of truth for your entire data ecosystem, ensuring that your pipelines are auditable, repeatable, and easy to maintain.

### Architecture üèóÔ∏è

The architecture of `Portkey` is a multi-layered, Python-based system designed for resilience and scalability. It's built on a decoupled, asynchronous design that separates the user's intent from the underlying implementation.

1.  **The Python Service (`Portkey-API`):** This is a FastAPI-based service that acts as the intelligent front end for your system. It receives a user's natural language query and orchestrates the entire query orchestration process.
2.  **The LLM Integration:** The `Portkey-API` makes an asynchronous API call to an LLM, passing it a query and a set of predefined prompts. The LLM's role is to act as a strategic analysis layer.
3.  **The Data Engines:** `Portkey` uses a Python client to run queries on Snowflake and Trino.
4.  **The Validation Layer:** A Pydantic-based validation layer checks the LLM's output for logical, semantic, and syntactical errors before any recommendations are presented to the user.

### High-Level Implementation Steps üõ†Ô∏è

1.  **Orchestration:** Build a FastAPI service with a primary endpoint `/query`.
2.  **Snowflake/Trino Integration:** Implement a data client that can connect to a running Snowflake and Trino cluster.
3.  **LLM Integration:** Create a structured prompt that tells the LLM to act as a query orchestrator.
4.  **Validation and Execution:** Implement a Pydantic-based validation layer that checks the LLM's output for correctness. The service should then run the query and return the results.
